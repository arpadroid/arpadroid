> Hi welcome to my lab, I am `arpadroid` (Andres Vaquero).

I am passionate about new web technologies and the future of web development.
My github showcases several projects focused in frontend web development, where I leverage the latest standards and web technologies, such as Web Components, in order to provide modern solutions to cutting-edge problems.
 
With over 18 years of experience in software engineering, I have transitioned from building web applications to architecting intelligent, scalable systems. 
My background spans from Principal Engineering roles at SaaS leaders like Objective Corporation to delivering high-volume media platforms for companies like Switch Media and Nine.

I am a Frontend-Focused engineering leader who operates at the intersection of Full-Stack Engineering and AI Strategy, helping organisations bridge the gap between technical execution and business growth. 
Whether modernising legacy architectures with React and TypeScript or integrating Large Language Models to drive automation, my goal is to deliver secure, scalable, and human-centred technology.

If you want to collaborate on something, please reach out!
