👋 Hi and welcome to my Github, I am `arpadroid` (Andres Vaquero).

> I am a passionate and avid explorer of new technologies, striving to define how we build scalable applications in the future. 
My github showcases several projects based around frontend web development, where I leverage the latest standards and web technologies, such as Web Components, in order to provide modern solutions to current problems.
 
> With over 19 years of experience in software engineering, I have transitioned from building web applications to architecting intelligent, scalable systems. My background spans from Principal Engineering roles at SaaS leaders like Objective Corporation to delivering high-volume media platforms for companies like Switch Media and Nine.

I focus on the intersection of robust Full-Stack Engineering and AI Strategy, helping organisations bridge the gap between technical execution and business growth. Whether modernising legacy architectures with React and TypeScript or integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) to drive automation, my goal is to deliver secure, scalable, and human-centered technology.

**Core Competencies**

- Architecture: Scalable Full-Stack Systems (Node.js, PHP, MySQL)

- Modern Frontend Engineering: React, Next.js, TypeScript

- Strategy: AI Integration, Technical Leadership, & Legacy Modernization

- Consulting: AI integration and modern web architecture
