`Hi and welcome to my lab! 🧪 I am arpadroid (Andres Vaquero).`

I am a **Frontend-Focused Full-Stack Engineer** passionate about the future of web development. 
My GitHub showcases projects focused on **Frontend Engineering**, where I leverage standards like **Web Components** to provide modern solutions to cutting-edge problems.

With over **18 years** of experience, I have transitioned from building web apps to architecting intelligent, scalable systems. My background spans from Principal roles at SaaS leaders like **Objective Corp** to delivering high-volume media platforms for **Switch Media** and **Nine**.

I operate at the intersection of **Full-Stack Engineering** and **AI Strategy**, helping organisations bridge the gap between technical execution and business growth. 
Whether modernising legacy architectures with **React/TypeScript** or integrating **LLMs** for automation, my goal is to deliver secure, scalable, and human-centred technology.
